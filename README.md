# IMDB TOP & BOTTOM MOVIES' REVIEW TEXT ANALYSIS

Basic Information About the Analysis
In this case I try to analyze wording that people use when they review “Good” and “Bad” Movies. Are they express themselves
differently? Which words are they choosing? Is there similarities between good reviews and bad reviews? For analysis, I took Top Rated 5 movies’ Reviews and Bottom Rated 4 movies’ Reviews from IMDB. Firstly, I analyze them separately then I gathered information together.  

Top 5 Rated movies were:
The Shawshank Redemption (1994),   
The Godfather (1972), 
The Dark Knight (2008),   
The Godfather: Part II (1974),  
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)

Bottom 4 Rated movies were:
Saving Chrismas (2014), 
Code name: K.O.Z. (2015), 
Turks in Space (2006), 
Going Overboard (1989)
